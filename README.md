Physical Computing
Physical computing is interactive physical systems that responds to its enviroment and changes its function based on it
Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are low power devices that are dedicated to one function and one function only. Examples of microcontrollers include: Microbits which produces LEDs that ca be programmed to into different patterns, The blackfin line of microcontrollers which are made to be low power processors that also can perform certain complex tast, PSoC chips which are designed to create and change mixed signal embedded applicaitons.
Sensors
Sensors are devices that detect changes in its enviroment and informs other electronics on its network of these changes. Examples of sensors are: Breathalyzers which detect the blood alcohol level of someone blowing into it and inform the police of the BAL, Microphones which detect souns going into them and produce the sound at a louder level on speakers.
Software
Software is the digital innerworkings of a computer that works with the hardware to function a computer. The two main types of software is application and system. System is the basic functions needed for a computer to work without these you coudln't do anything with a computer, while application software is user downloaded programs that do extra functions and help to complete taks for examples microsoft word.
Analog and digital signals
Analog and digital signals are different computing signals used to document things. An analog signal is a constant stream and can be used to measure or record different changes in a constant things like an audio frequencey while a digital signal is something that measures different seperated points of data.
